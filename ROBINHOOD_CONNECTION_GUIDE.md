## 🔍 How to Know It Worked

### Success Indicators:
- SnapTrade portal shows "Robinhood Connected" or similar message
- You see your Robinhood account listed in SnapTrade
- The app redirects back and shows connected status
- AI can access your portfolio data

### Failure Indicators:
- SnapTrade portal shows "No accounts connected"
- Empty accounts array in backend logs
- App still shows "Connect Robinhood" button
- AI says "I don't have access to your portfolio"

## 🚀 Quick Test

After following the steps above, try asking the AI:
- "What's in my portfolio?"
- "Show me my Robinhood holdings"
- "Analyze my current positions"

The AI should now have access to your real Robinhood account data!

## 📞 If Still Not Working

If you're still having issues after following these steps:

1. **Check SnapTrade Portal**: Go back to the SnapTrade portal and verify your Robinhood account is actually listed there
2. **Try Different Brokerage**: If Robinhood isn't working, try connecting a different supported brokerage
3. **Contact Support**: The issue might be with SnapTrade's integration with Robinhood

The key is making sure you **actually connect a brokerage account** in the SnapTrade portal, not just create a SnapTrade user account.
