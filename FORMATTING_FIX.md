## New Formatting Rules

### What AI Will NOT Use Anymore:
❌ `**bold text**` - markdown bold
❌ `### Headers` - markdown headers
❌ `![image](url)` - image syntax (charts auto-render)
❌ Excessive markdown
❌ Robotic formatting

### What AI WILL Use:
✅ Plain text with emojis
✅ Simple bullets (•)
✅ Clean numbered lists
✅ Natural line breaks
✅ Conversational tone
