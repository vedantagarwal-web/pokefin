## 🎯 **Key Components**

### 1. DebateCoordinator (`agents/debate_coordinator.py`)

**Main orchestrator that runs the entire research process.**

#### Methods:
```python
research_stock(ticker) -> ResearchReport
    ├── _gather_comprehensive_signals()  # Parallel signal gathering
    ├── _run_specialist_analysis()       # Quick fundamental/technical/sentiment scores
    ├── _build_bull_case()               # Bull agent builds case
    ├── _build_bear_case()               # Bear agent builds case
    ├── _run_debate()                    # Multi-round structured debate
    │   ├── _bull_rebuttal()
    │   ├── _bear_rebuttal()
    │   └── _judge_debate()              # Impartial AI judge
    ├── _calculate_conviction()          # 1-10 conviction score
    ├── _assess_risks()                  # Risk categorization
    └── _generate_research_report()      # Final output
```

### 2. Signal Gathering
**Pulls data from all sources in parallel:**
- Stock price
- Financial metrics (P/E, margins, growth)
- Company news
- Reddit sentiment (conditional)
- Twitter sentiment (conditional)
- 13F institutional changes (conditional)
- Insider trades (conditional)
- Unusual options activity (conditional)

### 3. Bull Agent
**Builds the strongest possible case for buying:**
```
Input:
- All signals
- Specialist analysis scores
- Market data

Output:
- Main thesis (one powerful sentence)
- Key strengths (3-5 bullish points with evidence)
- Catalysts (upcoming events)
- Price target (specific number with justification)
```

### 4. Bear Agent
**Builds the strongest possible case for avoiding:**
```
Input:
- All signals
- Specialist analysis scores
- Market data

Output:
- Main concern (one critical sentence)
- Key risks (3-5 bearish points with evidence)
- Warning signs (red flags in data)
- Downside scenario (what could go wrong)
```

### 5. Debate System
**Multi-round structured arguments:**
```
Round 1:
- Bull responds to Bear's concerns
- Bear responds to Bull's thesis

Round 2:
- Bull counters Bear's rebuttals
- Bear counters Bull's rebuttals

[Continues for N rounds based on config]

Judge:
- Evaluates all arguments
- Considers actual market data
- Determines winner (bull/bear)
- Assigns confidence (0-100%)
```

### 6. Conviction Scoring
**1-10 score based on:**
```python
conviction = (debate_winner_confidence / 10) + signal_boost

Signal Boosts:
+ Reddit sentiment > 75% = +1
+ Reddit sentiment < 25% = -1
+ 13F STRONG BUYING = +1.5
+ 13F STRONG SELLING = -1.5
+ Unusual BULLISH activity = +0.5
+ Unusual BEARISH activity = -0.5

If bear wins, invert score: conviction = 10 - conviction

Final: Clamp to 1-10
```

### 7. Action Mapping
```python
Conviction 8-10: STRONG BUY / BUY
Conviction 4-7: HOLD
Conviction 1-3: SELL / STRONG SELL
```

## 🚀 **How to Use**

### From User Interface:
```
User: "Should I buy NVDA?"

AlphaWealth automatically:
1. Detects recommendation request
2. Calls run_deep_research("NVDA", "standard")
3. Runs full debate process (60 seconds)
4. Returns formatted recommendation

Response:
"I ran deep research on NVDA. Here's what I found:

🎯 Recommendation: BUY
Conviction: 9/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Price: $875 → Target $1,100 (+26%)

💡 Key Thesis:
AI chip dominance with accelerating demand from enterprise AI adoption

📊 Signal Summary:
• Reddit: VERY BULLISH (85% bullish, 150 mentions, trending)
• Twitter: BULLISH (72% bullish, high engagement)
• 13F Filings: STRONG BUYING (5 new positions, 12 increased)
• Unusual Activity: Large call buying detected ($50M)
• Insider Activity: CEO bought 10K shares

✅ Bull Case Highlights:
1. 95% market share in AI chips, no real competitor
2. Earnings beat expectations by 15%, raised guidance
3. Multiple hedge funds initiated large new positions

⚠️ Bear Case Considerations:
1. Valuation stretched at 45x P/E vs 20x historical
2. China export restrictions pose regulatory risk
3. AMD increasing competition in datacenter

🎯 Bottom Line:
Strong buy with very high conviction. Multiple signals confirm institutional and retail bullishness. Risks exist but rewards outweigh them significantly. Consider scaling into position."
```

### From Code:
```python
from agents.debate_coordinator import DebateCoordinator
from agents.research_config import get_config

# Standard mode (60 seconds)
coordinator = DebateCoordinator(get_config("standard"))
report = await coordinator.research_stock("NVDA")

print(f"Action: {report['action']}")
print(f"Conviction: {report['conviction']}/10")
print(f"Target: ${report['target_price']}")
