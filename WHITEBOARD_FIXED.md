# ✅ Whiteboard Fixed - Now World-Class Like TradingAgents

## What Was Broken

**Issue**: Whiteboard showed "Not available" for ALL fundamentals
**Root Cause**: We were only calling `get_financial_metrics` but storing it in a key called `financials`, and NOT calling the actual `get_financials` tool

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Comprehensive Data Gathering (Like TradingAgents)

**Before**: Only 3 base signals
```python
get_stock_price()
get_financial_metrics()  # Only this
get_company_news()
```

**After**: 5 base signals (matching TradingAgents approach)
```python
get_stock_price()           # Market data
get_financial_metrics()     # Valuation metrics (P/E, ROE, margins)
get_financials()            # Actual financial statements ← THIS WAS MISSING!
get_company_news()          # Recent news
get_analyst_ratings()       # Analyst consensus ← NEW!
```

### 2. Fixed Data Structure

**Before**:
- Confusing: `get_financial_metrics` → stored in `signals["financials"]`
- Missing actual financial statements

**After**:
- Clear: `get_financial_metrics` → `signals["financial_metrics"]`
- Clear: `get_financials` → `signals["financials"]`
- Both sources used in data extraction

### 3. Enhanced Data Extraction

Now extracts from BOTH sources with proper fallbacks:
```python
data["fundamentals"] = {
    "pe_ratio": metrics.get("pe_ratio") OR financials.get("pe_ratio"),
    "profit_margin": metrics.get("profit_margin") OR financials.get("profit_margin"),
    # ... etc with smart fallbacks
    
    # PLUS new fields:
    "revenue": financials.get("revenue"),
    "net_income": financials.get("net_income"),
    "total_assets": financials.get("total_assets"),
    "total_debt": financials.get("total_debt"),
}

# NEW: Full financial statements for whiteboard
data["financial_statements"] = {
    "income_statement": { ... },
    "balance_sheet": { ... },
    "cash_flow": { ... }
}

# NEW: Analyst ratings
data["analyst_ratings"] = {
    "consensus": "Buy/Hold/Sell",
    "target_price": 500.00,
    "buy_count": 15,
    "hold_count": 8,
    "sell_count": 2
}
```

### 4. Whiteboard Enhancements

**NEW Sections Added**:
- ✅ **Financial Statements Table** - Income statement with actual numbers
- ✅ **Analyst Ratings Section** - Consensus, price targets, buy/hold/sell counts
- ✅ **Improved Fundamental Display** - Now pulls from 3 sources with smart fallbacks
- ✅ **Revenue & Net Income** - Additional key metrics displayed

**Better Data Display**:
- Checks `data.fundamentals` → `signals.financial_metrics` → `signals.financials`
- Shows "N/A" only if NONE of the sources have the data
- Formats large numbers properly ($1.5T, $500M, etc.)
