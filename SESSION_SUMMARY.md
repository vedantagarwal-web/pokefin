## 🎯 **WHAT WORKS RIGHT NOW**

### System Status

✅ Backend: http://localhost:8788 - RUNNING
✅ All 26 tools: REGISTERED & FUNCTIONAL
✅ Debate system: ACTIVE

### Test These Queries

**Basic Analysis:**
```
"What's NVDA's price?"
"Show me AAPL financials"
"Compare NVDA vs AMD"
```

**Social Sentiment:**
```
"What's the Reddit sentiment on TSLA?"
"Check Twitter buzz for GME"
"What are hedge funds buying?"
```

**🎯 THE BIG ONE (Runs Full Debate):**
```
"Should I buy NVDA?"
"Is TSLA a good buy?"
"Give me your best stock pick"
"Deep research on AMD"
```

**Expected Response Format:**
```
I ran deep research on NVDA. Here's what I found:

🎯 Recommendation: BUY
Conviction: 9/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Price: $875 → Target $1,100 (+26%)

💡 Key Thesis:
AI chip dominance with strong institutional validation

📊 Signal Summary:
• Reddit: VERY BULLISH (85% bullish, 150 mentions)
• Twitter: BULLISH (72% bullish)
• 13F Filings: STRONG BUYING (5 new positions)
• Unusual Activity: Large call buying detected

✅ Bull Case Highlights:
1. 95% market share in AI chips
2. Earnings beat by 15%, guidance raised
3. Multiple hedge funds initiated positions

⚠️ Bear Case Considerations:
1. Valuation at 45x P/E vs 20x historical
2. China export restrictions
3. AMD increasing competition

🎯 Bottom Line:
Strong buy with very high conviction. Multiple signals confirm...
