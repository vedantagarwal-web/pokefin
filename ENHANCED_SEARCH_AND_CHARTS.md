### 2. **Fixed TradingView Comparison Charts** 📈

#### What Was Broken:

#### New Configuration:

  autosize: true,
  symbol: mainSymbol,  // First ticker
  interval: "D",
  theme: "dark",
  studies: [
    {
      id: "Compare@tv-basicstudies",
      inputs: {
        symbol: "AMD",  // Comparison ticker
        source: "close"
      }
    }
    // ... more comparison stocks
  ]
}
```
